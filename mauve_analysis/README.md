Unitig 1 needed to be reverse complemented as evident by this analysis. I took the [unitig 1](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/seq1_16536_16552_circcq_fixed.fasta) FASTA file and used [this R script](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/scripts/reversecomplement.r) to create a reverse complement. Then I took the new sequence and created [this](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/combined-revcomp-unitig-1-2.fasta) FASTA file which is a combination of the reverse complemented unitig 1 and unitig 2 and used that for this Mauve analysis. [This](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/kalgicidaOT1.fasta) K. algicida FASTA file was used to map against.

In short, [combined-unitig-1-2-vs-kalgicidaOT1](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/mauve_analysis/combined-unitig-1-2-vs-kalgicidaOT1) was used to create [unitig1+unitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/mauve_analysis/unitig1%2Bunitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png) and [combined-revcomp-unitig-1+unitig-2-vs-kalgicidaOT1](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/mauve_analysis/combined-revcomp-unitig-1%2Bunitig-2-vs-kalgicidaOT1) was used to create [revcompunitig1+unitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/mauve_analysis/revcompunitig1%2Bunitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png)

The images show that [revcompunitig1+unitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/mauve_analysis/revcompunitig1%2Bunitig2-vs-kalgicidaOT1.png), which has the FASTA file with unitig 1 reverse complemented and the unitig 2 FASTA file combined into one, is less "messy" and that indicates that [unitig 1](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/seq1_16536_16552_circcq_fixed.fasta) is likely in the correct orientation now.
