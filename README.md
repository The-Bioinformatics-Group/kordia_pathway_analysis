# Kordia Pathway Analysis

This is the repository for all files and updates relevant to the Kordia sp. pathway analysis project. 

###April 7, 2016.
Unitig_1 was reverse complemented using the reversecomplement.r script and the resulting file was used in a comparison with the K. algicida OT 1 genome in Mauve. To get a quick overview of the results there are two screenshots of the results in the Mauve folder.

The same FASTA file was submitted to BASys for annotation.

BASys annotation of reverse complemented FASTA file from yesterday complete.
The settings that were used are "Gram Stain: Negative" and "Contig is: Circular". Everything else was set to default.

A Pathway Tools database (PGDB) was created and compared to the Kordia algicida OT 1 PGDB from Pathway Tools and the results are as follows:

Organism | Pathways | Protein Genes | RNA Genes | Size (bp)
-------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------
Kordia algicida | 200 | 4465 | 64 | 5,033,129
Kordia sp. | 149 | 1713 | 0 | 5,493,758

It's safe to say that something is missing from the current genbank file for our Kordia.

The Kordia algicida OT 1 [FASTA genome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_DS544873.1) is linear and for that reason I have submitted a BASys analysis of the reverse complement unitig 1 + unitig 2 FASTA file with the "Contig is:" setting set to "Negative" to see if that changes the results.

And for good measure I have also submitted the Kordia algicida OT 1 genome to BASys to see if BASys identifies the same number of genes as the PGDB in Pathway Tools has.
