# Kordia Pathway Analysis

This is the repository for all files and updates relevant to the Kordia sp. pathway analysis project. 

###April 7, 2016.
Unitig_1 was reverse complemented using the reversecomplement.r script and the resulting file was used in a comparison with the K. algicida OT 1 genome in Mauve. To get a quick overview of the results there are two screenshots of the results in the Mauve folder.

The same FASTA file was submitted to BASys for annotation.
