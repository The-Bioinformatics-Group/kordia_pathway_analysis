# Kordia Pathway Analysis

This is the repository for all files and updates relevant to the Kordia sp. pathway analysis project. 

###April 7, 2016.
Unitig_1 was reverse complemented using the reversecomplement.r script and the resulting file was used in a comparison with the K. algicida OT 1 genome in Mauve. To get a quick overview of the results there are two screenshots of the results in the Mauve folder.

The same FASTA file was submitted to BASys for annotation.

BASys annotation of reverse complemented FASTA file from yesterday complete.
The settings that were used are "Gram Stain: Negative" and "Contig is: Circular". Everything else was set to default.

A Pathway Tools database (PGDB) was created and compared to the Kordia algicida OT 1 PGDB from Pathway Tools and the results are as follows:

Organism | Pathways | Protein Genes | RNA Genes | Size (bp)
-------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------
Kordia algicida | 200 | 4465 | 64 | 5,033,129
Kordia sp. | 149 | 1713 | 0 | 5,493,758

It's safe to say that something is missing from the current genbank file for our Kordia.

The Kordia algicida OT 1 [FASTA genome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_DS544873.1) is linear and for that reason I have submitted a BASys analysis of the reverse complement unitig 1 + unitig 2 FASTA file with the "Contig is:" setting set to "Negative" to see if that changes the results.

And for good measure I have also submitted the 
Kordia algicida OT 1 genome to BASys to see if BASys identifies the same 
number of genes as the PGDB in Pathway Tools has.

Afternoon: I annotated the reverse complemented FASTA file with PROKKA and 
the results are very promising as shown in the table below. A bug in PROKKA 
caused the first analysis to fail because I didn't get the genbank file which 
was the whole purpose. I had to change ">1|quiver" in the FASTA file to ">1" 
because having a pipe "|" character in the name somehow causes an issue, this 
has more info: [Bug discussion](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka/issues/127)

Organism | Pathways | Protein Genes | RNA Genes | Size (bp)
-------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------
Kordia algicida | 200 | 4465 | 64 | 5,033,129
Kordia sp. | 224 | 4686 | 63 | 5,493,758

Given the larger genome it makes sense that our Kordia has more protein genes 
and thus more pathways. 

I have placed the PROKKA analysis files in /nobackup/data9/oskar/prokka

###April 11, 2016

The BASys annotation results from the runs that were started last friday
 with the reverse complemented contig_1 + contig_2 genome set to 
linear instead of circular, and the Kordia algicida OT 1 genome manually 
downloaded from RefSeq is in.

Here's some of the statistics of the new databases.

Organism | Pathways | Protein Genes | RNA Genes | Size (bp)
-------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------
Kordia algicida*  | 200 | 4465 | 64 | 5,033,129
Kordia sp. linear** | 149 | 4795 | 0 | 5,493,758
Kordia algicida*** | 148 | 1631 | 0 | 5,033,129 
Kordia sp. PROKKA | 224 | 4686 | 63 | 5,493,758

*Kordia algicida OT 1 PGDB downloaded through Pathway Tools.

**Our Kordia annotated with BASys

***Kordia algicida OT 1 genome annotated by BASys.

In this case it is obvious that BASys is not performing as expected, it fails
to properly annotate the RefSeq genome of Kordia algicida OT 1.

Going forward I propose that we analyze the PROKKA annotated genome PGDB and
base any further research on that. We can compare it to the Kordia algicida
PGDB that was downloaded using Pathway Tools, and we should keep in mind that
this is all automatic annotation and the identified pathways are not necessarily
actually present in the bacteria.
