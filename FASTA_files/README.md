These FASTA files have been used in various steps during this project. The [kalgicidaOT1.fasta](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/kalgicidaOT1.fasta) was analyzed with PROKKA to create the [genbank file](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/genbank_files/PROKKA_KalgicidaOT1.gbk) for the K. algicida pathway database in Pathway Tools.  
The [combined-revcomp-unitig1-2.fasta](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/combined-revcomp-unitig-1-2.fasta) was analyzed by PROKKA to create the [genbank file](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/genbank_files/PROKKA_K-sp.gbk) that was used to create the pathway database in Pathway Tools for our Kordia genome. It was created by making a reverse complement of [unitig 1](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/seq1_16536_16552_circcq_fixed.fasta), pasting 111 "N" and then pasting the [second unitig](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/unitig_2_circ_asof_may_2015.fasta). [This](https://github.com/The-Bioinformatics-Group/kordia_pathway_analysis/blob/master/FASTA_files/unitig1revcomp.fasta) is the reverse complemented FASTA file of unitig 1.
